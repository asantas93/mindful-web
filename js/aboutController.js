      bio: 'My approach to massage therapy works with an understanding of western anatomy and physiology and grounded in the eastern tradition of mindfulness. My passion for massage therapy grew out of my personal experience with generalized anxiety and panic attacks. Massage to the scalp created grounding and at thirteen years old I understood at a core level the benefits of touch. I work to facilitate soft tissue balance in the body along with clear mind and open heart.',

      bio: 'Massage provides both the client and the therapist focus, balance, and attention to detail in the movement and function of the body. I see massage therapy as an exercise in self-awareness and a movement towards independence in the maintenance of one\'s body-mind. When I work with clients, whether they are athletes in training, or someone seeking relief from chronic pain, I try to give them a sense of what\'s going on both in the specific area needing immediate attention and in the body as a dynamic whole. That awareness is the first step towards relaxation and relief, and in many cases self-care and independence. I emphasize the dynamic of body-mind in muscular tension--how thinking manifests in muscular contraction and repetitive thoughts without attendant action creates tension and somatic dysfunction. I always work to help my clients understand what I find going on in their bodies, and provide exercises for those clients who wish to release trapped tension by participating in their own healing and relaxation.',
